## 8/19/2021: AM2RLauncher 2.1.2 release!

Since this was released so shortly after 2.1.1, we've kept the recovery tool around. 

This update fixes some UI issues with game updates that we ran into trying to release 1.5.3. Changelog can be found on GitHub, as usual.

## 8/16/2021: AM2RLauncher 2.1.1 release!

Auto-updater was still busted, so there's another recovery tool. It should be fully resolved now, but we all know what happened when we said that last time.

This was primarily a Linux update, but there are a few QoL changes to Windows as well. Changelog can be found on GitHub, as usual.

## 6/7/2021: AM2RLauncher 2.1.0 release!

We goofed and the auto-updater was broken. Ideally you'll see an update recovery tool for ~5 seconds and then get to use the AM2RLauncher 2.1.0 upon launch. Changelog can be found on GitHub, as usual.

Note: Mod saves will likely disappear if they were set to use a custom directory due to a bugfix. Help locating these missing saves can be found on the Official AM2R Discord Server.

## 3/27/2021: AM2RLauncher 2.0.0 release!

The release was off to a bit of a rocky start, but after a hotfix and build push we managed to solve an issue regarding the auto-update routine. Thank you all for your patience.
