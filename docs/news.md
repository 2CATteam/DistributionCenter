## 6/7/2021: AM2RLauncher 2.1.0 release!

We goofed and the auto-updater was broken. Ideally you'll see an update recovery tool for ~5 seconds and then get to use the AM2RLauncher 2.1.0 upon launch. Changelog can be found on GitHub, as usual.

Note: Mod saves will likely disappear if they were set to use a custom directory due to a bugfix. Help locating these missing saves can be found on the Official AM2R Discord Server.

## 3/27/2021: AM2RLauncher 2.0.0 release!

The release was off to a bit of a rocky start, but after a hotfix and build push we managed to solve an issue regarding the auto-update routine. Thank you all for your patience.
